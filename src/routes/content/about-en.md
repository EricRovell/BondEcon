Claus Moser once said that the numbers were like words: they cast light on peoples’ lives, and what could be more interesting than that? My answer is that it is more interesting to know exactly where the light is emanating from, and whether it is blinding or illuminating?

Every day the new and/or renewed economic data is published. *What a fortunate our world is, with such an accuracy!* – Wrong thinking. While some numbers do provide evident data, the others may either be biased, or mean more rather than show. It depends on both external and internal conditions, just guess how "initial jobless claims" matter during the Covid-19 pandemic, "oil price" - for the members of OPEC+, "remittances as % GDP" - for the labor-exporting countries... 

All of it requires deep analysis and creates challenges for all of us, and, especially, for those interested in how the World Economy is working *(fortunately, I'm a part of this world-wide team!)*.

This website is here to provide you with some information of how to understand the numbers the World Economy and the countries so care about.

As since you are here, you are the one. This is way!
