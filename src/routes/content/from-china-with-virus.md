# 13% is Russia’s export to China for 11M19

Some key industries are at risk, i.e.:

### Energy
  - oil exports appr. 12%
  - gas exports – may be affected mostly by falling demand, not yet suffered
  - coal - 70% of Kolmar's exports go to China. The company suspended the deliveries as requested by the Chinese party.

### Other industrial production and services
  - forest industry – 10% of raw material exports, lower demand;
  - transport: airlines – regular flights from Russia to China suspended since Feb-1, charter flights suspended from Feb-14. For 1-25 of January, the total number of passengers was 199.84 th. Russian airline industry is facing losses since 2018 – and current situation may further worsen its performance;
  - transport: railway services – from Feb-3 to Mar-1, passenger rail services between Russia and China are [temporarily](http://press.rzd.ru/news/public/ru?STRUCTURE_ID=654&layer_id=4069&refererLayerId=4067&refererPageId=704&id=95196) suspended.

_22% is Russia’s import from China for 11M19._

Some key industries are at risk, i.e.:

### Automobile industry
  - Most companies' stoks of equipment and component parts are avalilable until March (and near future).

### Consumer goods
  - clothes and shoes (39% of total) – Wildberries says everything’s fine for now;
  - metal goods (37%);
  - electronic equipment (50-60%) – both ozon and M-video believe everything’s fine - for now. But, according to Russian International trade center the stocks, on average, will cover demand for 3 months (remember about the holidaaaays we have in Russia in February and March; demand will grow up!);
  - watches (30%);
  - musical instruments (40%);
  - toys (over 70%);
  
### Consumer goods: food items
  - import of oranges from China is suspended since Jan-6, import of fish suspended since Jan-9;
  - “Magnit” suspended import of fruit and vegetables from China (appr. 3%). X5 Retail Group says Chinese’s share is lower 1% (import not suspended yet). Russian Retail trade association [says:](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/7673143) don’t worry.

_The expected effect is pro-inflationary. Lowering exports from China will limit supply on Russian market - this is especially valid for consumer good/servises. Ahead of the holidays in Russia - St. Valentine's day, Defender of the Fatherland Day, International women's day - demand for goods (particularly, goods from China)  is typicaly rising, which may result in rising consumer prices._

_Businesses will suffer because of falling external demand, making activity in corporate sector lower._
